# The purple team's objectives and duties include:
- Collaborating with the red and blue teams, analyzing how they work together and recommending any necessary changes to the current exercise or noting them for future reference.
- Seeing the big picture and adopting both teams' mindsets and responsibilities. A purple team member, for example, will collaborate with the blue team to analyze how events are detected. After that, the team member will join the red team to discuss how the blue team's detection capabilities can be hacked.
- Analyzing the findings and managing the appropriate corrective measures, such as fixing vulnerabilities and providing employee awareness training.
- Getting the most out of the exercise by implementing what you've learned and bolstering your defenses.
- Organizations will be able to benefit from far more personalized, real-world assurance by establishing a scenario in which the Red Team and Blue Team collaborate (Purple Team). The blue team's detection and reaction capabilities will be measured in a way that is much more closely matched with real-world threats.
