# The red team's objectives and duties include:
- Compromising the target's security via obtaining information, penetrating their systems, or breaking their physical perimeters.
- Avoiding the blue team's detection. Many attacks happen in a split second, making it difficult for the blue side to neutralize the threat before the 'damage' is done.
- Taking use of flaws and faults in the target's infrastructure. This identifies technological security weaknesses that must be addressed in order to improve the organization's security posture.
- Initiating hostile action, such as advanced penetration testing, to provide a reliable assessment of the blue team's defensive capabilities.

# The methods used by the red team include: 
- Initial reconnaissance - gathering information about the target using open-source intelligence (OSINT).
- Establishing communication with the target's network by deploying command-and-control servers (C&C or C2).
- Using decoys to keep the blue team guessing.
- Using social engineering and phishing techniques to persuade employees to give or expose information in order to breach their computers.
- Cloning an administrator's access cards to obtain access to regions that aren't prohibited
- Penetration testing, both physical and digital - usually done in a vacuum.
