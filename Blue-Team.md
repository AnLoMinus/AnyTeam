- Obtaining fresh threat intelligence and prioritizing necessary measures in light of the dangers.
- Analyzing traffic flow and data flow.
- Conducting DNS research
- Performing digital analysis to establish a baseline of network activity and make it easier to detect odd or suspicious activities.
- Examining, configuring, and monitoring security software across the network
- Ensure perimeter security measures like firewalls, antivirus, and anti-malware software are correctly configured and current.
- Using least-privilege access, which involves giving each user or device the least amount of access possible to assist prevent lateral movement across the network in the case of a breach.
- Using micro-segmentation, a security approach that divides perimeters into small zones to keep access to all parts of the network separate.
